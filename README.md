<h1>Create your own snippets</h1>
<ol>
<p>You can easily define your own snippets without any extension. To create or edit your own snippets, select User Snippets under File > Preferences (Code > Preferences on macOS), and then select the language (by language identifier) for which the snippets should appear, or the New Global Snippets file option if they should appear for all languages. VS Code manages the creation and refreshing of the underlying snippets file(s) for you.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hit > shift + command + p and type snippets</li>
  <li>Select Preferences: Open User Snippets</li>
  <li>Choose the language type for which you want to add the custom snippet</li>
  <li>vscode has comments to explain on how to add a snippet, as described on :> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets">vsdoc</a></li>
  </ol>
  
Lets say, we want to open custom snippets for the language GO. Then we can do:

1.Hit > command + p
2.Type: go.json + enter And you land on the custom snippet page
  
  
  <b>Snippets are defined in a JSON format and stored in a per-user (languageId).json file. For example, Markdown snippets go in a markdown.json file.<b>
